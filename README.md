Camera Proj

Motivation: After taking Advanced Practical Embedded Software Development at the University of Colorado,
            I felt like I didn't fully understand / learn several of the topics.  This project is a recreation
            of the 2 main projects presented in the class.  My goal is to create a mitulously crafted code set
            which highlights the following:
              * code comments that clearly show operation of blocks of code
                  - include disclaimer, doxygen file descriptors
              * software architecture diagram that shows the interealtionships of files, functions, and IPC
              * 3 different "sensors" - presence detector, SD card R/W, and webcam
              * generic makefile that can be used without modification for any project
              * IPC that minimally used queues (used in the class projects), other options will be explored
